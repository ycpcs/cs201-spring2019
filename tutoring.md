# Evening Sessions (Monday through Thursday, 6:00 to 8:30)
Drop-in tutoring sessions will be held Monday through Thursday from 6:00 to 8:30.  These sessions are a great way to get help with labs, assignments, or anything else you have questions about.  There will be at least 2 tutors available each evening.

# In-Class Tutoring
We will have in-class tutors this year for assistance with the labs and assignments.  Those tutors will be available for the last 15-30 minutes of each class, and will remain for much of the 45 minute gap that follows the class - for at least an hour of tutoring for each class session.

# Thursday
