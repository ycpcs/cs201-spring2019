# Evening Sessions (Monday through Thursday, 6:00 to 8:00)

Drop-in tutoring sessions will be held Monday through Thursday from
6:00 to 8:00.  These sessions are a great way to get help with labs,
assignments, or anything else you have questions about.

All evening sessions are in KEC 123.

* Monday: Kyle Leatherman
* Tuesday: Doug Nicholson
* Wednesday: Andrew Georgiou
* Thursday: Quintin Herb


# In-Class Tutoring

We will have in-class tutors this year for assistance with the labs and assignments.  Those tutors will be available for the last 30 minutes of each class.

* 11:00 section (KEC 123): Marie Kiley
* 2:00 section (KEC 119): Kyle Eidson

Please see [How to ask for help](http://faculty.ycp.edu/~dhovemey/askingForHelp.html) for some advice on how to ask good questions (ones that lead to learning.)
